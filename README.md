# CISC486 Course Project - Group 16: Assignment 4

## Setup Instructions

1. Go to the Releases tab of the GitHub, go to Assignment 4 and download one of either `a4_windows.zip` or `a4_linux.zip`, depending on your operating system.
2. Extract the folder anywhere on your computer and run `CISC486-Project-G16.exe` on Windows or `CISC486-Project-G16.x86_64` on Linux
3. You can either host a game or join a game hosted by another computer (they must be on the same local network) by entering its IP address into the input field on the main menu.
   1. Whoever is hosting the game is assigned the Agent player, and the joining player will be the Drone. To swap characters, the second player must host a new game.
   2. To find the host's local IP, open a command prompt and run `ipconfig`, or (on Windows) go to `Settings > Network & internet > Wifi/Ethernet > [network name]`, and in both cases look for the IPv4 address.
